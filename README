The Chatroom project consists of server side (server.js) and client side (room.js and home.js) code.
room.html is a Mustache template used to generate a new chatroom, which is styled by room.css.
home.html, which is styled by home.css, is a homepage that contains a link that, when clicked, would bring
the user to a new chatroom with a randomly generated unique identifier. Each room identifier is inserted
into the "room" table in the database so that a list of previously active chats can be shown on the left
of each chatroom. When the user clicks on a previously active chat, the page is redirected to that chat.
Every time a user enters a room, he/she is prompted to enter a nickname to identify him/her in the chat.
When a user sends a message, his or her message is immediately appended to the list of chat history on
his/her page (this seems the most intuitive because the user would expect to see his/her own message
immediately). On the other hand, an interval (in room.js) is set up to poll messages from the server's
"message" database every 5 seconds so that messages from other users in the same chatroom would show up
on the user's page. Each chatroom also contains a "Leave chat" button to redirect user back to the homepage.
When a user enters a previously active room, a list of chat history is appended to the page immediately.
When a user attempts to enter a room not generated by the link on the homepage, a new chatroom would be generated
and its identifier(made up by user) would be inserted into the database.


Small html bug: chat history is set to scroll to the bottom since new messages are usually the ones of interest.
However, due to the updates, it behaves weirdly when the user tries to scroll the history up.
